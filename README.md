# Deep Generative Models

The key idea a want to explore in this repository is "how we can use deep learning to learn any kind of data distribution" (images, sounds, datapoints, etc.) and the main way to achive this goal will be by investigating the unsupervised learning techniques provided by Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks and Flow-based Generative Models.

In this repository the following are provided:
- My insight and summary of the most relevant papers.
- Code implementation for each paper architecture.
- Projects usings differents architectures.
